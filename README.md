## Description

Service that parses and loads data from file with specified file path monitored (as was specified in the task description)

SQL Dump provided for creating tables in PostgreSQL, however the names of the tables should be changed to be Upper Cases in order to fully test the service

I used PostgreSQL with EntityFramework, howerver it's just an example, it can be integrated with any other suitable ORM or database of choice
